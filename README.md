The matlab codes developed in this paper entitled "Convective Dynamics of Swarming Enzymatic Nanomotors" are available in this repository. It contains computational modeling that shows UrNMs swarms move upward under different control factors, and computational results describing the swarming behaviour shaped by confinement.
